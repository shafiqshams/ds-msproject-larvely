# Mobile App for Data Science Project
## A concept to see fish larvae on the map


## Data
Rath, Willi, Schmidt, Christina, & RÃ¼hs, Siren. (2021). Mediterranean Sea Trajectory Data Examples (Version v2020.03.31.1) [Data set]. Zenodo. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4650317

- This project shows the trajectory data.
- I have used only 09 dummy data points just to display them on the map as a custom marker.
- Moreover, details of fish larvae are visible when you click on the marker.
- Info Card is visible and will be navigated to the fish details scene.

- On the main map scene, you can find a toggle button to turn on and off the clustering of the data points.
- This will enable the markers to come up together and form a cluster displaying the number of fish larvae which are nearby.


## Design
- All the wireframes were self created just to show an idea how this whole process will work.
- You can find all the details inside mobileapp folder.

## Coding
- I developed this whole application just in 2 weeks and working on the specified commit days which you can find in the commit history.
- Number of hours invested around 40 - 60
- As this project is simply to display the data points and nothing more, it contains hard-coded practices as well but still I tried to somehow manage it to the adequate level of acceptance.
- StyleSheets using react native styles and background knowledge of CSS.
- Splash screen and app icon is self modified, designed and uploaded.

## Installation
- Navigate to mobileapp folder, try running `yarn install` or `npm install` to install all the dependencies from package.json file.
- Start your emulator or device preloaded
- Try running `yarn android` to start react-native run-android command.

- More easier way to see the app in action is just download the app-release.apk on your android device.

## Mission

Pick one of the following topics:

- _**Visualize:**_ Build an app for interactive visualization of the data.
- _**Optimize:**_ Structure the data for the fastest possible lookup based on region and trajectories. (May also be part of one of the other topics.)
- _**Analyze:**_ Use machine learning to identify and quantify emerging pathways.
